# Real-Time-Stress-Monitoring-System-using-IoT-Technology - MAJOR PROJECT
Environment : UBIDOTS STEM , ARDUINO IDE
Tools : ESP 32, MAX 30102 , GSR Sensor , DS18B20 
Description  : In this IoT project, I have explained how to make Real-Time Stress Monitoring System using IoT Technology. With this IoT project, you can check  humans Stress levels like  heart rate , temperature and Human body humidity. Based on the results of human , Admin get a response MAIL regarding the stress levels of the human and  buzzer also activates.This hardware is connected to  UBIDOTS STEM platform using WIFI.
